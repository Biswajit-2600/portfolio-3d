1. Core Idea

Your website isn’t just a resume — it’s a world your visitor explores.
Every section of your life (skills, certificates, projects, achievements, etc.) will be represented by 3D elements.

Example concept:

🏠 Home/Spawn Zone — a small island or futuristic room where visitors “enter” your world.

🧠 Knowledge Lab — interactive holograms representing your skills and technologies.

🏆 Achievement Chamber — showcases your certificates and awards as floating artifacts or glowing badges.

🧰 Project Workshop — machines, models, or terminals showing your projects as interactive 3D demos.

🛣️ Journey Path — a timeline road or space corridor showing your career journey.


Stage 2: Technical Stack (Modern 3D Web Setup)

We’ll use the most flexible and modern stack available today:

Layer	Tool	Purpose
3D Rendering	Three.js or React Three Fiber (R3F)	Core 3D visuals, physics, lighting, animations
Frontend Framework	React + Vite	Component-based structure, fast rendering
Animations	Framer Motion + GSAP	Smooth transitions, camera movements
UI Library	shadcn/ui or Tailwind CSS	Modern minimalist UI overlay (menus, buttons)
Models	Blender	Design all 3D figurines (certificates, achievements, etc.)
Hosting	Vercel or Netlify	Fast deployment and CDN delivery
Optional	React Three Drei, Postprocessing	Helpers for camera controls, reflections, depth effects


Stage 4: Workflow

Design 3D models in Blender → Export to .glb or .gltf

Import them in React Three Fiber → Place in your virtual world

Add interactivity → Camera transitions, click events

Integrate data → Dynamic content from JSON (certificates, skills, etc.)

Deploy online → Use custom domain, SSL, and SEO setup




Recommended Theme & Color Palette (AI + Futuristic + Lively)

For an AI/ML + modern tech aesthetic, go for a Neo-Cyberpunk Futuristic palette — glowing accents, soft gradients, and deep contrasts.

Element	Recommended Colors	Notes
Background	#0D0D0F → #1A1A1F (Deep dark gradient)	Feels like an infinite digital void
Primary Accent	Electric Blue #00FFFF or Neon Purple #9D00FF	Classic AI / Neural aesthetic
Secondary Accent	Magenta #FF00A6 or Cyber Green #00FFB3	Adds energy and glow contrast
Text	White #FFFFFF or Soft Gray #CFCFCF	High readability
Glow / Highlights	Cyan glow (blurred shadow filters or emissive materials)	Makes UI feel high-tech
Lighting Style	Rim lights + subtle ambient bloom	For realistic 3D model lighting
